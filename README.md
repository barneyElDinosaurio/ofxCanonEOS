3. Replace the EDSDK.framework from the SDK download by the one from EOS Utility:
	1. Show Package Contents from Application/Canon Utilities/EOS Utility/EOS Utility.app
	2. Copy Contents/Frameworks/EDSDK.framework over to YOUR_CANON_SDK_LOCATION/EDSDK/Framework (remove the previous one)

4. Copy the EDSDK folder into this directory: OF > addons > ofxCanonEOS > libs

6. Add DDP.framework and EDSDK.framework to your xcode project.
